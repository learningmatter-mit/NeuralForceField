"""
IMPORTANT NOTE: Piecewise functions can be a bit tricky in pytorch:
If there are divisions by 0 in different branches of the piecewise definition,
this can lead to nan values in gradients when automatic differentiation is used
(even if the problematic branch should in theory not be evaluated at all). As a
workaround, input values for all branches must be chosen such that division by
0 does not occur. For this reason, there are some lines that may seem
unnecessary, but they are crucial for autograd to work properly.
