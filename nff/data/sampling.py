    Generate weights that combine balancing of species,
    configurations, and Zhu-Nakamura hopping rates.
    Args:
        props (dict): dataset properties
                zhu_kwargs (dict): dictionary with information about how
                to calculate the hopping rates.
        spec_weight (float): weight given to equal species balancing.
                If equal to 1, then p(A) = p(B) for all species. If equal
                to 0, species are not considered at all for balancing.
                Intermediate values reflect the extent to which you care
                about balancing species during sampling.
        config_weight (float): the weight given to balance among configurations.
                Must be <= 1.
        zhu_weight (float): the weight given to sampling high-hopping rate geoms.
                Must be <= 1 and satisfy `config_weight` + `zhu_weight` <= 1. The
                difference, 1 - config_weight - zhu_weight, is the weight given to
                purely random sampling.
        extra_category (bool, optional): whether to add an extra category for the
            cluster assignment, occupied by any geoms not close enough to a geom
            in `ref_nxyz_dic`
        extra_rmsd (float, optional): if using `extra_category`, this is the RMSD
            beyond which a geom will be assigned to an extra category.
        device (str): device on which to do the RMSD calculations
    Returns:
        results (dict): dictionary with final weights and also config weights for
            future use.
